Terminal is a way to interact with your computer without using your mouse. Instead you type commands using the keyboard.

1. cd /examplefolder
this moves you in to another directory/folder. In this case, the "examplefolder".

2. cd ..
this moves you back one level from the directory/folder you are currently in.

3. nano "filename"
this opens a basic text editor built in to terminal and creates a new file with the name "filename"

4. ls
this command lists the contents of the current directory/folder you're in.

5. say Hello World
this reads out whatever you write after say _______

6. clear
this clears the terminal window of all your previous commands

7. ls -l
this command lists the contents of the current directory/folder you're in but in the format of a vertical list rather than "ls" usual long single line

8. ditto -V /old/work/ /new/work/
copies "work" folder to the new location. -V means verbose and prints a line to the Terminal detailing what is being copied as it is being copied.

9. cat /path/to/file
this will open a file no matter what it is. files like mp3's will just show up as gimerish "4839hun$$T%nin%#)jknjfk".

10. open -a /Applications/AppName.app /path/to/file.txt
open a file with the app of your choice
